# Azure.Mobile [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-lightgrey.svg)](LICENSE)

**`Azure.Mobile` is a framework for rapidly creating iOS and android apps with modern, highly-scalable backends on Azure.**

The objective of the framework is to:

1. Enable developers to create, configure, deploy all necessary backend services fast — ideally under 10 minutes with only a few clicks
2. Provide native iOS and android SDKs with delightful APIs to interact with the services

## What's included?

It includes one-click deployment templates and native client SDKs for the following:

- Database
- Blob/File Storage
- Authentication
- Push Notifications
- Serverless Functions
- Client/Server Analytics


## How do I use it?

## How is this different than Azure Mobile Apps (formally Azure App Services)?

coming soon...


## What is the price/cost?

Most of these services have a generious free tier. [Sign up for a Azure free account][azure-free] to get $200 credit.
