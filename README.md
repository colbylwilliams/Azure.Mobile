# Azure.Mobile

**[Azure.Mobile](https://aka.ms/mobile) is a framework for rapidly creating iOS and android apps with modern, highly-scalable backends on Azure.**

_Azure.Mobile has two simple objectives:_

1. _Enable developers to create, configure, deploy all necessary backend services fast â€” ideally under 10 minutes with only a few clicks_
2. _Provide native iOS and android SDKs with delightful APIs to interact with the services_


## What's included?

It includes one-click deployment templates and native client SDKs for the following:

- Database
- Blob/File Storage
- Authentication
- Push Notifications
- Serverless Functions
- Client/Server Analytics



## How do I use it?

We're working on several different configruration options, each with a one-click-deploy template.

- [iOS SDK][azure-ios]
- [Android SDK][azure-android]


## How is this different than Azure Mobile Apps (formally Azure App Services)?

_coming soon..._



## What is the price/cost?

Most of these services have a generous free tier. [Sign up for a Azure free account][azure-free] to get $200 credit.
